### History of Linux
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student. He aimed to develop a free and open-source version of the MINIX operating system. Over time, it has grown with contributions from developers all around the world.

### Linux vs Other Operating Systems
Linux offers unique advantages over proprietary operating systems like Windows and macOS. Its open-source nature means it can be modified freely, and it is less prone to malware.
