### What is Linux Operating System?

The Linux Operating System is a Unix-like operating system built upon the Linux Kernel, which serves as its core component. The Linux Kernel is responsible for managing interactions between the computer's hardware and software resources, ensuring efficient and smooth operation. However, the Kernel alone does not constitute a complete operating system. To form a fully functional system, it is integrated with various software packages and utilities, collectively known as Linux distributions. These distributions provide users with a secure and effective environment for running applications and performing tasks. Each distribution is designed to meet specific user needs and preferences.
