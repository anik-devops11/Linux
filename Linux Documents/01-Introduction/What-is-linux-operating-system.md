### What is Linux Operating System?

The Linux Operating System is a Unix-like operating system built upon the Linux Kernel, which serves as its core component. The Linux Kernel is responsible for managing interactions between the computer's hardware and software resources, ensuring efficient and smooth operation. However, the Kernel alone does not constitute a complete operating system. To form a fully functional system, it is integrated with various software packages and utilities, collectively known as Linux distributions. These distributions provide users with a secure and effective environment for running applications and performing tasks. Each distribution is designed to meet specific user needs and preferences.

### History of Linux
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 while he was a student. He aimed to develop a free and open-source version of the MINIX operating system. Over time, it has grown with contributions from developers all around the world.

### Linux vs Other Operating Systems
Linux offers unique advantages over proprietary operating systems like Windows and macOS. Its open-source nature means it can be modified freely, and it is less prone to malware.
