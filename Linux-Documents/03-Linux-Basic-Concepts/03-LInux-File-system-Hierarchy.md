## Linux File System Basics

The Linux file system is structured like a tree, starting from the root directory `/`, which serves as the base for everything else. In Linux, all items—such as files, directories, and even hardware devices—are represented as files, making interactions with the system consistent and straightforward. Permissions are set to control who can read, write, or execute a file, and are applied to the file owner, a group, and others. Paths are used to navigate the system: an **absolute path** starts from the root (e.g., `/home/user/documents/report.txt`), while a **relative path** starts from your current directory (e.g., `./report.txt`). To access external devices like USB drives, they are "mounted" into the file system, usually in directories like `/media` or `/mnt`. This design makes Linux well-organized, efficient, and secure for both users and the system.

### Linux Directory Structure

The Linux directory structure follows a hierarchical, tree-like structure that starts from the root directory, represented by `/` . Each directory under the root has a specific purpose, allowing users and system processes to easily locate files and resources. Here is an overview of the most common directories.

### Here, we provide a brief discussion of the Linux directory structure.

| Directory    |    Description    |
|--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`          | The root directory, which is the base of the entire Linux file system.                       |
| `/dev`       | Contains device files representing hardware components like hard drives, printers, etc.      |
| `/usr`       | Stores user system resources, including:                                                     |
|              | - **`/usr/bin`**: Executable files available for all users.                                  |
|              | - **`/usr/local`**: User-specific software or scripts.                                       |
|              | - **`/usr/man`**: Manual (help) pages for commands.                                          |
|              | - **`/usr/share`**: Shared data like icons or documentation.                                 |
|              | - **`/usr/lib`**: Libraries needed by programs.                                              |
| `/bin`       | Contains essential user commands for booting and basic system operations (e.g., `ls`, `cp`).|
| `/lib`       | Stores essential shared libraries for system commands and programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`.   |
| `/home`      | Contains user home directories (e.g., `/home/user1`, `/home/user2`).                         |
| `/tmp`       | Temporary files generated by applications or during installations.                          |
| `/var`       | Stores files that grow in size, such as logs and caches:                                     |
|              | - **`/var/log`**: System and application log files.                                          |
|              | - **`/var/lock`**: Lock files for resources used by processes.                               |
|              | - **`/var/temp`**: Temporary files used by running services.                                 |
| `/sbin`      | Contains essential system binaries for system administration (e.g., `reboot`, `ifconfig`).  |
